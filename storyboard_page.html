        <h1>Website Storyboard</h1>
        <p>The Website Storyboarding page contains drawn layout designs of pages, as well as their descriptions, information about the sites aesthetics and theme and the websites hosted link.</p>
        <p>Hosting: The website is hosted using github pages and can be accessed using the link: <a href="https://lexciib.github.io/"> https://lexciib.github.io/</a> </p>
        <p>
            Aesthetics and Theme: The inspiration for the colour palette of the website was a drawing I had done all must a year ago that I wanted to feature on the front page.
            The drawing consisted mostly of earth tones which gave it a warm and cosy atmosphere and I aimed to replicate that in the website I created.
            For that reason I choose a mostly earth-toned pastel colour palette, featuring heavily in green and browns.
