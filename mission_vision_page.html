                As someone who is known for their meticulous planning, my aspiration never includes any particular
                career or was anyway dependent on me even having one.
                Somewhere along the way, whether the media, my peer or some other factor this became a point of shame
                for me.
                Because under capitalism person who is not economical productive holds no values.
                I was most often reminded of this fact whenever someone asked why I was going to university.
                I didn't have some glossy answer about how much I looked up to some big tech oligarch like Elon Musk or
                Bill Gates and wants rich and successful like them.
                Computer Science was just something I found cool and wanted to learn more about, and I find the school
                structure more conducive to learning than some online Bootcamp or websites.
                But that answer brings out a rage in people like no other and no one wants to be told over and over
                again how "Someone else would kill for the opportunities you have" or
                "You're wasting potential". Because learning out of a love of learning is a sin. So I chose the easy
                route and started telling people what they wanted to hear.
                "I do this because I want a bright future and a promising career in tech." And now I'm here doing a
                degree I do not intend to use because I'd much rather be a homemaker than work 9 to 5,
                partially out of love for the subject and partially out of fear of failing in a world where I put all my
                eggs in a basket I was told not to put them in to begin with.

            <h2 align="center"> <a name="vision"> My Vision </a> </h2>
            <p>Breakdown to the core, all I want is to live a life that feels worth it waking up every morning. And such
                my vision is <br> "To become someone who undeniably deserves a place in the world."</p>

            <br>
            <h2 align="center"> <a name="mission"> My Mission </a> </h2>
            <p>
                "To put the skills and knowlegde I've acquire over my life to serve my community, to act was a mentor to
                those who lack one and
                to be offer support to those in need."
